<!-- Things I have learned through this:

- Adding Custom Colors
- React Slick
- Customizing Carousal
- Tailwind on how to use ::before => before:none before:h-0
- To give border 1px, just write border, that's all
- Navbar using Headless UI -->

<!-- npm uninstalled: -->
  <!-- npm i @material-ui/icons -->
